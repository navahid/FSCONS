<h3> Introduction
</h3>

<p>User freedom is the most important property of tomorrow's
infrastructure. This property is necessary to safeguard the relative
freedom of speech, provided by the Internet against increasingly
aggressive attacks by preying commercial and opportune state interests.
</p>

<p>In this abstract of the talk for FSCONS 2010 we first try to define freedom
in computer work. Then the problem of increased centralization of the
Internet is discussed, and a number of ongoing threats to this freedom
are identified. We then present the <em>Free Email Association</em>, which
built-up infrastructure we have, and our principles. Finally we try to
sketch, what we think the future paths might look like.
</p>

<h3> Background
</h3>

<p>The centralisation of influence and rectification of decision-making is
not unique for the Internet. This is written in a wider context of
general social criticism of economic and cultural globalisation and the
current forms of the globalisation of information flows. Many decisions
are made in multi-lateral arenas, where the democratic control is
limited.<sup><a name="id1" href="#ftn.id1">1</a></sup> A decreasing number of transnational operators, not only
controls the means of production and the production of goods, but also
have great influence in markets demands.
</p>

<p>The Internet is, or will soon be, the most important communication
medium in the majority of the industrialized world. The story of its
development from its conception as a highly distributed network through
the establishment of the free and open web towards the increasingly
privatized web, we see today, is indeed saddening for those, who takes user
freedom seriously. A few strong parties control major segments of
important infrastructure, that millions of users depend on every
day. Those who control the technology and its infrastructure, also have
power over its users.
</p>

<h4> Computing, computer labour, and power over the infrastructure
</h4>

<p> The <em>Free Software Foundation</em> suggest definition of <em>free software</em>
consisting of four requirements: "freedom to run, copy, distribute,
study, change and improve the software". (Free Software Foundation "The
Free Software Definition") As a complement to those we define the more
general <em>freedom with regard to own computer labour</em> <sup><a name="id2" href="#ftn.id2">2</a></sup> as requiring that
</p>
<ol><li> the work is performed exclusively with free software,
</li>
<li> the work is performed with computer hardware that entirely is at one's possession and control,
</li>
<li> the information worked with is information that one possess, and
</li>
<li> the result from the computer work also is at one's possession and control.
</li>
</ol>
<p>We here use "information" to denote data and documents that are the
object of computer work. In this context <em>computer labour</em> is defined as all use of computers, and <em>own computer labour</em> as computer work performed for one's own part.<sup><a name="id3" href="#ftn.id3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<h4> Internet and its servers
</h4>

<p> The <em>Internet</em>, seen as an infrastructure scheme, was constructed as a
distributed <em>peer-to-peer</em> non-hierarchical network of independent and
self-determined parts.<sup><a name="id4" href="#ftn.id4">4</a></sup> Despite this immanent property, the Internet today, seen from a regular user's point of view, is structured in a hierarchical manner around a decreasing number of server clouds, which are continuously growing in size and power. Historically the meaning of <em>servers</em> was to gather and publish information provided from its clients. However, in many applications today, publishing is not 
performed as a separate process, and the clients are no longer always independent. For example social networking sites, like Facebook, often require their users to perform their work directly on the company's servers. (Moglen 2010)
</p>

<h4> Software as a service
</h4>

<p> A concept introduced in the spirit of centralisation is <em>Software as a
Service</em> (SaaS). Shortly SaaS means that users are invited to perform
their computer work on or through a network server on Internet or a
local network. The main purpose of SaaS is to separate <em>possession</em>
and <em>ownership</em> of software from its <em>usage</em>. This software is said
to be "licenced on demand". (Turner 2003)
</p>

<p> In this text <em>Software as a Service</em> is used in a more narrow sense in
accordance with Stallman (Stallman 2010), to mean one's own computer
work on hardware that the user do not control. Popular Internet services
that are examples of SaaS are Google Docs and Facebook, but the concept
is widely used. Computer work performed with this software is non-free
in a double sense; using SaaS also leads to <em>vendor lock-in</em>. However,
the complex of lock-in problems reach far outside SaaS.
</p>

<h4> The infrastructure of email
</h4>

<p> The email infrastructure is not an exception from the tendency towards
centralisation and rectification of Internet's services and usage. We
now see even large institutions being lured in by the economic benefits
offered by these large scale solutions.
</p>

<p> Email communication through the Internet involves several computers and
servers, among those a <em>mail user agent</em>, a computer program
controlled by the sending person; several <em>mail transfer agents</em>,
Internet servers responsible for getting the mail though using the SMTP
protocol; <em>domain name system servers</em>, servers keeping track of the
addresses to all those servers; and finally another <em>mail user agent</em>,
used by the receiving person to read the emails. It is also common to
make use of extra inbox handling services like <em>IMAP access</em> or
<em>webmail</em>, which usually involve separate servers.
</p>

<p> What about email and freedom? We here need to distinguish what part of
emailing which is one's own computer labour and which is not. Editing email definitely is, along with all sort of contact management. The transfer process,
however, is not; whether the email arrives is of course of great concern
to the sender, but there is generally no human activity (directly)
involved and thus no actual work performed. In principle the same holds
also for the process of receiving email. However, most popular email
services are not content with that:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Some
sites whose main service is publication and communication extend it with
"contact management", keeping track of people you have relationships
with. Sending mail to those people for you is not SaaS, but keeping
track of your dealings with them, if substantial, is SaaS. (Stallman
2010)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And using SaaS is not free computer
labour. Furthermore, the question of whether hiring a company for handling one's email,
implies usage of non-free computer labour or not, might not be the only
matter of importance.
</p>

<h4> Privacy and survelliance
</h4>

<p> With large clientele comes a lot of power. Google is currently not the
largest email service provider; both Windows Live Hotmail and Yahoo Mail
has more customers. (Brownlow 2010) 
We believe nonetheless that it is important to single Google out as a company, because of how effectively they utilize privacy invading schemes, and because of how these are integrated between their services.
Together with Google's e-mail service one also gets services
that probably was not asked for: advertisement, semantic analyses of
email contents, and spying. (Moglen 2010) The data resulting from
Google's analysis and espionage is later used indirectly in marketing
campaigns with Google's customers or sold directly to third party. Google
is profiting on their email users with the means of the users' private
information provided by themselves.
</p>

<p>Google link that data to individuals' surf activities using Google's
search engine, Google accounts and cookies. Additionally, many websites
utilize Google's JavaScript APIs, website statistics or reCAPTCHA
service, which indirectly exposes individuals to Google's supervision.
</p>

<h3> Organisation for a change
</h3>

<p>Technology has never been neutral. Behind technology changes and
innovations today lie commercial interests and social factors. On the
one hand, the ownership structure of technology companies and their
endeavour for profit ensure, that usage of their services for work and
communication never will be free. On the other hand, only a fraction of
the everyday Internet users have knowledge and resources enough to
create free alternatives on their own hand. The question is also:
What we can reasonably expect from an average user in terms of
engagement in their privacy and freedom?
</p>

<p> Our idea is to form an association and together take back a small, but
important, part of our Internet life, namely the email communication
infrastructure. We gather around several servers that receives and
stores the members' email. The purpose of the association is to render
it possible for individuals to bring their computer usage under their
own control, and to show that user freedom is possible, even only
through active, prolonged and collective struggle.
</p>

<p>In more detail, we start with five or six servers spread out in Sweden
and Europe connected through the Internet: at the very least two mail
exchange and one IMAP server, separate backup and log servers, and
hopefully a webmail server. In the beginning we will not have an SMTP
send mail service, and we will hire the DNS service from third
party. Though we will have tight economic boundaries, our focus on
reliability and stability forces us to try hard to maintain a
sufficiently high level of redundancy.
</p>

<p>The email service provided through the Free Email Association is free as
in free speech. This because of the democratic
structure and of non-profit and commonly owned organisations like the
Free Email Association. The association promises to
</p>
<ol><li> work hard to receive email for the sake of its members in a reliable manner
</li>
<li> protect its member's integrity, that is to never
     <ul><li> read or analyse its members emails, either manually or automatically, (possibly with exception for voluntary spam filter services and alike)
     </li>
     <li> gather statistics about or analyse member's traffic through the association's servers, and
     </li>
     <li> under no circumstances hand out information about members, their emailing and other activities, or any other information to third party, and
     </li>
     </ul>
<li> provide for transparency regarding administration, economy and the decision-making process.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p> Transparency and continuous information about the work of the board is
of cause extra important, and the democratic regime requires constant
attention. A declaration of principles serve as a founding document for
the association, but still a high level of trust is laid on the elected
officers.
</p>

<h3> On the long term
</h3>

<p> We recommend and encourage everyone to perform his or her's computer labour
with free software at machines that are in their own possession. But
many solutions on Internet servers, like Google Docs and Facebook, are
quite usable and practical and adopted to a 
modern way of meeting and working computer-aided.
The Free Software Community has a great challenge in the
creation of free and distributed alternatives, where free means that
their usage imply only free computing.
</p>

<p> Despite this, we must not deceive ourselves into thinking, that the final
and greatest challenge is about building physical infrastructure or
programming advanced distributed social networking solutions. The real
challenge is to get people engaged in the issue of the Internet's power
structures and in their own freedom and privacy.
</p>

<p> No one in their right mind would put their blind trust in a government
that was dabbling in surveillance on a scale anywhere near what Google
is doing. But when it comes to Google, their marketing strategy has been
so successful that many people need no additional guarantees, that Google
will behave &ndash; people are willing to take Google's word for it.
</p>

<p> The reason behind the described changeover of the Internet is
structural. The structural tendency, as described, is that already
powerful operators get even more power, when computer labour is generally
becoming less free. Structural problems need structural change, but
projects like the Free Email Association serve as an alternative to
structural change for those, who are eager to establish free
alternatives. In the long-term, however, we realise that a larger social
change on a structural level is necessary. The best we can hope for, is to give a small contribution, bringing about that change.

<h3> Footnotes

<sup>[<a name="ftn.id1" href="#id1">1</a>]</sup>
Good, recent examples are the European Unions IPRED directive or the
ACTA agreement.
<br>
<br>
<sup>[<a name="ftn.id2" href="#id2">2</a>]</sup>
Stallman uses <em>your own computing</em> to denote what we call <em>one's
own computer labour</em>. [2] We use the latter because of its broader
associations.
<br>
<br>
<sup>[<a name="ftn.id3" href="#id3">3</a>]</sup>
Stallman points out that work performed as employee in some company
or in a cooperation project as Wikipedia is not one's own computer work,
but a part of that company's or project's work. In that case it is not
one's own freedom that is threatened, but the company's or
project's. (Stallman 2010):
<br>
<br>
<sup>[<a name="ftn.id4" href="#id4">4</a>]</sup>
Technically the parts of a network are <em>nodes</em>, which in the case
of Internet are servers, switches, and personal computers, and
<em>edges</em>, which are interconnecting wires.
