<div class="description markdown"><p>The issue around the taboo of money is central in present critical economic times. We are in a situation where the incapacity to re-define how we deal with money could resolve in an a severe damage to society as we commonly refer to it: contrary to what happens with information systems, there are no backups with money systems.  Since the Internet revolution - and also as parts of national communities - we are almost unconsciously using national currencies. We either agree to pay with or
   are obliged to acquire something, which is not – by law – our own property; simultaneously, we are migrating on-line towards the hyper-centralized and exclusively debt-based cashless society, whose
   collateral are the very citizens animating it. The provocative thesis about the Digital-Coin Rule for a Free Society takes the pace from philosophy of economics and technology both applied to draw the lines of the juridical innovation via direct vote of a bottom-up self-regulating P2P G/Local multi-currency system. As a result, central banking, the financial system and conventional politics would lose strategic monopolistic power while the Multitude fabricating society will experience money - more desirably - as a common: a decentralized and horizontally accessible monetary system, inherently cheaper to run and structurally more resilient than the present one.
