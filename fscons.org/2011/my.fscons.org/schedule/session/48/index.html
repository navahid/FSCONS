<div class="description markdown"><p>If you had a chance, how would your alter the structure of your state?
</p>
<p>What if, instead of being built in smoky back rooms, the fundamental documents
   of the nations we lived in were made in public, out on the Internet for all to
   see?  What would this mean for the fight for civil rights?
</p>
<p>Constitutions are the fundamental building blocks of states, and they frame
   the legal context for all of a society.  Law is just another system, however,
   and constitutional law is a uniquely self-contained legal system.  Over the
   past thirty years, we've learned how to build systems in public.  In the
   security world specifically, we've also learned a lot about analyzing formal
   systems.  The same kinds of analytic techniques used in security and
   related spheres can be used on law -- indeed, the security of law has
   far-reaching implications, especially for issues like civil rights.
</p>
<p>This past year, Iceland took a radically new, open approach to attempting to
   rewrite their constitution, and I was part of a team that attempted to provide
   analytic support to the Constitutional Assembly.  We crowdsourced
   translations, used a variety of textual and semantic analysis techniques, and
   worked on threat models for the new constitution.  This talk will look at the
   way the Assembly worked, the tools and methods we used to support them, some
   legal history going back to the 17th century, and what's up next for the
   Constitutional Analysis Support Team.
