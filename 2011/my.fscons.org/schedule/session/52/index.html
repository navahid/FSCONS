<div class="description markdown"><p>Over the years, there has been numerous resolutions, petitions and declarations calling for <a href="http://openparliament.eu/petition">Free Software in the European Parliament</a>. All good initiatives, all with good intentions, hard working activist communities behind, and with well meaning and supportive politicians - but have they really delivered the change we called for? In the bleak back-light of the recent <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/223224/eu_bodies_plan_upgrade_to_windows_7_without_public_tender.html">36.000 desktop "upgrade" to Windows 7</a> and "unusual" procurement procedures worth <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2011/06/06/the-european-commissions-locked-in-syndrome">millions of Euros</a>, should we conclude the state of Free Software in the European Parliament would have been even worse without these efforts?
</p>
<p>My answer is yes, but we need to find new ways and complementary methods to established political tools. Starting with a call for help at <a href="http://epfsug.eu/blog-entry/ep-needs-your-help-come-janson">FOSDEM in February</a> the European Parliament Free Software User Group added the perspective of "proof of concept and running code" to the activists' toolbox in that regard. And as EPFSUG has both patrons, members and supporters, there is something for <a href="http://epfsug.eu/mission-statement">everybody who wants to help to</a>:
</p>
<p><p>
   <ul>
   <li> Assist people interested in using free software in the European Parliament </li>
   <li>Drive adoption of free software in the European Parliament's information infrastructure </li>
   <li>Push for use of open standards, to ensure equal access for citizens using free software </li>
   <li>Work in cooperation with like-minded groups in Europe and around the world  </li>
   </ul>
    </p>
   <p>
   <br />
   Estonian independent MEP <a href="http://tarand.ee">Indrek Tarand</a> is a member of the <a href="http://greens-efa.eu">Greens/EFA Group</a> and has been the host of most EPFSUG meetings.  Do you know any MEP who likes Free Software? Ask him/her to become a Patron! Do you know how Free Software can improve your working environment?  Come and tell the people who work in the European Parliament! Are you developing free software tools to serve democracy? Come show it!
